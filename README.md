# classification-algorithms
Implementations of the Naïve-Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier in python3.

Pre-requisites:
• Python3
• Jupyter notebook

Steps to run: (Navigate to the root directory of the project)
1) Open the file .src/classification-algorithms.ipynb
2) Run every cell in the Jupyter notebook (runtime may vary, avg: ~40 minutes)
3) Output will be logged under each cell

Note: Since runtime can be long, the notebook has been uploaded with results already printed. If you wish to run again please be patient as the algorithms have not been properly optimized (notes on why located in the Jupyter notebook).
